# Summary for the third lesson

## Storing special characters in strings

- what happens, if we hit enter inside our string?
- how can we put a newline character into our string? The `"\n"` character.
- what is character escaping and why do we need it? 
- the `"\t"`, `"\""`, `"\'"`, and `"\\"` characters.

## Learning some new number-manipulations

- what are __binary operators__?
- how can we raise a number to a power (exponentiation)? The `**` operator.
- __integer division__ without the `int` function. The `//` operator.
- what is __modular division__? The `%` operator.

## Learning how to manipulate booleans

- how to check whether a string contains a substring with the `in` keyword?
- negating the `in` keyword with `not`
- the `and` and `or` binary operators and their evaluation tables
- combining the `in`, `not`, `and` and `or` operators into complex expressions
- type checking with the `type` function and `is` operator
- equality checking with the __comparing equality__ (`==`) operator
- the not equal operator (`!=`)

## In-place operators

- the misery of writing too much
- simple modification of variables using `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, and `**=`
