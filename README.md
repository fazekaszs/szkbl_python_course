# Supplementary data and codes for the SzKBL group's Python course
This repository was created for the containment of supplementary material
for the Python basics course. Each lesson's material is stored within a
separate folder. Each folder contains a `README.md` file that sums up the main
takeaways from each lesson. If you are taking the course, you can use this to
refresh your knowledge obtained from the corresponding lesson. Also, besides the
readme-file, there are scripts in the folders, which are cleaned-up versions of the
scripts we wrote during the lessons. I aimed to explain what each "block of code" does
through heavy commenting in these scripts, so it is also recommended to look at these
if you get stuck on a problem. Have fun!
